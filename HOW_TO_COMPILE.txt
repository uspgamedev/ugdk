== Controlling what is Built

The following CMake variables changes what is built.

- UGDK_BUILD_TESTS         ## automated tests
- UGDK_INTERNAL_FREETYPE   ## build and link against the embedded freetype
- UGDK_INTERNAL_GLEW       ## build and link against the embedded glew
- UGDK_INTERNAL_SDL2       ## build and link against the embedded SDL2
- UGDK_INTERNAL_SDL2_IMAGE ## build and link against the embedded SDL2_image
- UGDK_INTERNAL_SDL2_MIXER ## build and link against the embedded SDL2_mixer
- UGDK_CREATE_BINDINGS     ##    No longer going to be supported
- UGDK_LUA_BINDINGS        ##       No longer going to be supported
- UGDK_PYTHON_BINDINGS     ##   No longer going to be supported


== Build instructions

Considering the dependencies listed above satisfied.


---------
GNU/Linux:

Open a terminal on the directory containing this file and execute:
 $ mkdir build && cd build
 $ cmake ..
 $ make

Try using either 'ccmake' or 'cmake-gui' for an interactive interface to control CMake variables.


---------
Windows:

Open the CMake GUI.
Choose as the 'Where is the source code' to be the path to the directory containing this file.
Choose any path for 'Build the binaries'.

---------
Android:

Set the enviroment variable ANDROID_NDK to the directory you installed the Android NDK.

Open a terminal on the directory containing this file and execute:
 $ mkdir build && cd build
 $ cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/android.toolchain.cmake -DANDROID_NATIVE_API_LEVEL=android-9 ..

---------------
OLD, tofix?



=========
Mac OS X: outdated
=========

1) Install CMake 2.8 or a higher version

2) Install the following libraries:
- SDL 1.2
- SDL_Image 1.2
- SDL_Mixer 1.2
- SDL_TTF 2.0

3) Open a terminal in the same folder of this file.

4a) If you want to compile a Universal Binary for distribution:
   $ cmake -DUNIVERSAL=y . (Do not forget the '.' at the end)
   $ make
4b) If you only want to run the library at your Mac:
   $ cmake . (Do not forget the '.' at the end)
   $ make

Optionally, you can use CMake to generate files for your favorite IDE. Search
for cmake -G options.

=======
Windows
=======

1) Have the following software installed:
- CMake 2.8.11 or higher

1.1) Optional software:
- SWIG 2.0.4 (must be on PATH)
- Python 2.6 (must have registry entry)
- Lua 5.1 (must have LUA_DIR set)

2) Set the SDL2DIR variable to a folder that contains a include and a lib directories,
containing the following libraries:
- SDL 2.0
- SDL_Image 2.0
- SDL_Mixer 2.0

3) Using CMake, generate the project files for the IDE you wish to use.

4) Build using the generated project.
